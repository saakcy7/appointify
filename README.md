we have a server and client folder of chatbot

cd to server of chatbot
cd src/ChatBot/server
run command "npm start" This should start the start

then open another terminal of vs code using the + sign on terminal

move to the root folder (appointify)
run command "npm start" to run frontend

in address bar write localhost:3000/cat
There you will see the chatbot icon
OPEN IT !!

The chatbot server runs in PORT 8000
frontend react app run in PORT 3000

The Appointify server in main branch runs in port 5000 but Mine didn;t run in port 5000. So for this branch the appointify server should run in PORT 4000 as the react app fetches data from localhost:4000
